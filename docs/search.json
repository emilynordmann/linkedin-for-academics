    "text": "0.1 Why This Book Exists\nI consider myself lucky to have experienced academic Twitter of the 2010s - I have long-standing research collaborations with people I met on Twitter, I owe my job at Glasgow to Twitter, and I even made a new best friend from Twitter. And then it collapsed into a hateful cesspit and academic social media fractured. Some academics migrated to Bluesky, Mastodon and Threads, but, to everyone’s genuine surprise, many, including myself, have settled on LinkedIn.\nIn 2020, Daniel Quintana wrote Twitter for Scientists, a practical guide to using Twitter for academic networking and research dissemination. This book is a sequel of sorts, adapted for LinkedIn and updated for the current landscape. It is not a replacement and if you want comprehensive guidance on why academics should engage with social media at all, you should still read Dan’s original. This book assumes you have already decided that some form of professional social media presence might be useful and focuses on making LinkedIn work for you specifically.",

It also includes material that Dan’s original did not emphasise, in particular, using LinkedIn to share teaching practice and open educational resources. Not because Twitter was bad for this, but because teaching-focused academics have historically been underserved by guidance on academic social media use and because I am a ride-or-die education-focused academic.",

    "text": "2.1 The Post-Twitter Landscape\nDan’s original book makes the case for why academics should use social media at all. The short version is that academia is not a meritocracy, good work does not automatically find its audience, and social media provides a way to share your work that does not depend on gatekeepers. If you want the full argument with evidence, read Chapter 1 of Twitter for Scientists.\nThis chapter addresses the different question of why LinkedIn is a viable alternative (if not a true spiritual replacement) for Good Twitter.\nFor about a decade, Twitter was the main home of academic social media with researchers sharing papers, building new and wider collaborations, and creating genuine communities around shared interests (in addition to mixing in enough memes and shitposting to never take itself too seriously). It was chaotic, occasionally toxic, but undeniably useful and fun.\nThat era is over and changes to the platform since 2022 have driven many academics elsewhere. Research tracking academic migration found that approximately 18% of previously active academics moved from Twitter to Bluesky between 2023 and 2025. Others scattered to Mastodon, Threads, or simply left social media entirely.\nThe academic social media landscape is now fragmented and there is still no single platform that replicates what Twitter offered at its peak. LinkedIn is one option among several, with particular strengths and limitations.",

    "text": "2.2 What LinkedIn Offers\nA large, professionally-oriented user base. LinkedIn has over a billion members, with more than 50% holding a degree. Your potential audience includes academics, but also professionals in industry, policy, healthcare, education, and other sectors where your work might have relevance.\nStability. Unlike platforms that have undergone dramatic changes in ownership or policy, LinkedIn has remained relatively consistent. Your investment in building a presence is less likely to be wiped out by platform upheaval or the whims of a ketamine binge.\nProfessional context. LinkedIn’s culture is explicitly professional. This shapes expectations in ways that can be useful - users post under their real name and are linked to their workplace so bad behaviour and toxicity is much less common. Posts are generally taken seriously and the tone tends toward constructive rather than combative.\nAcademic discourse. LinkedIn does support genuine academic discussion. It is slower and less spontaneous than Twitter was, but substantive conversations happen. You can share papers, debate ideas, and engage with others’ work. The threading is clunkier and the real-time back-and-forth doesn’t take hold as much, but the discourse exists.\nReach beyond academia. If your work has implications for practice, policy, or the public, LinkedIn connects you with people who might actually use it. Practitioners, policymakers, journalists, and industry professionals are all active on the platform.",

The rapid-fire exchanges and viral/trending content that characterised academic Twitter do not really happen on LinkedIn. Conversations unfold over hours or days rather than minutes. This can be frustrating if you are used to real-time debate or enjoy a side order of chaos.\nAlgorithmic unpredictability. Like all platforms, LinkedIn uses algorithms to determine what appears in feeds. Organic reach has declined significantly over recent years. Your posts may not reach your followers reliably, and there is little transparency about why.\nA corporate aesthetic. LinkedIn’s culture skews toward corporate professionalism. The performative positivity and motivational content can be grating. You will scroll past a lot of “I’m humbled to announce” posts.",

These connections can be professionally valuable and intellectually stimulating.\nTo be clear, Twitter was also good for this. The educational community on academic Twitter was vibrant and supportive but Dan’s original book did not explicitly have teaching as a focus, so this book addresses that gap.",

The headline appears in search results, next to your comments, and when you appear in someone’s feed so it should tell people what you do and why they might want to follow you.\n\n\n\nProfile with headline, photo, and banner\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Your About section\nThis is your chance to say who you are in your own words. Write in first person. Be specific about your work and interests. Include enough personality that you sound like a human being.\nHere is mine as an example:\n\nAbout I am Associate Dean for Learning and Teaching and Professor of Evidence-Informed Education at the University of Glasgow. My research predominantly focuses on lecture capture, how it can be used as an effective study tool by students and the impact on students from widening participation backgrounds as well as those with disabilities and neurodivergent conditions. In all my work, I draw on theories of learning from cognitive science and self-regulation, as well as theories of belonging and self-efficacy.\n\n\nMy leadership roles have centred around supporting those on the learning, teaching, and scholarship track. I am currently lead of the College of MVLS LTS Network and previously founded and led the Pedagogy and Education Research Unit in the School of Psychology and Neuroscience.\n\n\nI am based in the School of Psychology and Neuroscience. My teaching is varied although centres on cognitive psychology and beginner data skills in R and I am a vocal advocate of open science and open educational resources where as a member of the PsyTeachR team I has authored several open-access data skills books and tutorials.\n\n\nWhen I am not at work I like to climb mountains, do stand-up comedy, and play videogames.\n\n\nAlso, super gay.\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Profile photo and banner\nUse a photo where people can see your face. It does not need to be a fully professional headshot, but it should be recognisable and suitable for a work profile. People identify posts by the thumbnail, so consistency helps and if you change your profile photo too often, you’ll losing your “branding”.\nThe banner image is optional but useful. Common choices include a photo of your institution, an image related to your research, a landscape from where you live, or something that reflects your personality.\n\n\n3.1.4 The rest\nLinkedIn has a lot of other profile sections - as an academic I would recommend using the Experience section to list your academic positions and Education to state your degrees and which institutions you have attended. The rest (Featured posts, Skills, Awards, Publications etc.) is up to you and I think these have diminishing returns for the effort they take.",

This means the default button on your profile becomes “Follow” rather than “Connect.” People can still connect if they click through, but following becomes the easier option.\nThis is useful if you want a broader audience.

    "text": "3.3 Understanding the Feed\n\n3.3.1 How the algorithm works\nLinkedIn uses an algorithm to determine what appears in your feed. You will not see everything from everyone you follow. The algorithm prioritises content it predicts you will engage with, based on your past behaviour, the content’s early performance, and various other factors that LinkedIn does not fully disclose.\nA few things that seem to matter based on available evidence:\nEarly engagement. Posts that get likes and especially comments in the first hour tend to be shown more widely. This is why posting when your audience is active matters and you can schedule your posts if you’re not available during these times.\nComments over likes. Comments signal higher engagement than reactions. Posts with substantive comments tend to perform better.\nDwell time. How long people spend reading your post matters. Content that people actually read (not just scroll past) gets favoured.\nOriginal content. There is reasonable evidence that reposts get less engagement than original posts. Analysis from multiple sources suggests reposted content may receive around 85% less engagement than original content, and that heavy reposting can drag down your overall metrics. If you want to share someone else’s content, writing your own post that references or builds on their work typically performs better than using the repost button.\nLinks. Single external links in posts appear to reduce reach, possibly because LinkedIn wants to keep users on the platform. The evidence on this is mixed, but many people now put links in the first comment rather than the post itself. Whether this actually helps is unclear, but it has become a common practice.\nDon’t obsess over the algorithm - it will change, the evidence is often anecdotal, and being an interesting person who posts stuff people want to engage with matters more than gaming the system. But it helps to understand the basics.\n\n\n3.3.2 Saving posts [bookmarks}\nAn annoying feature of LinkedIn is that in algorithmic view, it can sometimes be hard to find a post you have previously seen, unless you remember exactly who posted it. This is particularly annoying when the page refreshes without you asking it to. You can save posts by clicking the three dots at the top of the post then “Save”.\n\n\n\nSaving posts for later\n\n\nYou can access your saved posts on the desktop by navigating to your home page and then in the left hand menu bar towards the bottom, click Saved items. On mobile, you just hit your profile picture and Saved posts is one of the items that comes up in the menu bar.\n\n\n3.3.3 Switching to chronological\nBy default, LinkedIn shows you an algorithmic feed. You can switch to chronological order if you prefer to see posts in the order they were posted.\nOn desktop: look for the feed sorting option near the top of your feed and select “Recent.” On mobile: tap your profile picture, then Settings &gt; Account preferences &gt; Preferred feed view and select “Most recent.”\nNote that LinkedIn tends to reset this to algorithmic periodically, so you may need to switch it back.",

    "text": "3.5 Interacting with Content\n\n3.5.1 Reactions\nLinkedIn offers several reaction options: Like, Celebrate, Support, Love, Insightful, Funny. For most purposes, just use Like. The others exist but rarely matter. Reacting acknowledges content but does not boost it significantly. Comments matter more for visibility.\n\n\n3.5.2 Comments\nLinkedIn massively favours comments for reach to the points where a comment on someone else’s post can be more valuable for building connections than your own posts. That said, if you’re going to comment, say something substantive. “Great post!” adds nothing. Engage with the actual content: ask a question, add a related point, share your own experience, respectfully disagree.\n\n\n3.5.3 Reposts\nYou can repost others’ content, either directly or with your own commentary added. As noted above, reposts tend to get less engagement than original posts. If you want to amplify someone’s work, consider writing your own post that engages with their content and tags them, rather than using the repost function. You will likely reach more people and add more value.\nIf you do repost, add your own thoughts. A bare repost without commentary is the lowest-value option.\n\n\n3.5.4 Direct messages\nYou can message people directly. This is useful for conversations that do not need to be public, or for reaching out to people you want to connect with. Keep messages short, especially if you are contacting someone you do not know. Say who you are, why you are reaching out, and what you are asking. Long messages from strangers often go unread.\nDo not use DMs to pitch products or services. Do not send connection requests with sales messages attached. And for the love of god, DO NOT DM WOMEN TRYING TO HIT ON THEM.",

When you connect with someone, you both see each other’s content and can message directly.\nWhen sending connection requests, it can be helpful to add a note explaining who you are and why you want to connect. Generic requests without notes are often ignored, especially by people who receive many requests.\nGood reasons to connect: you met at a conference, you work in similar areas, you have engaged with their content, you have a genuine professional reason to be in contact. Bad reasons: you want to sell them something, you are collecting connections for the numbers.\n\n\n3.6.3 Who to follow\nStart with people you actually know: colleagues, collaborators, people you have met at conferences. Then expand to people whose work you find interesting, people working in your area, organisations and journals relevant to your field.\nLinkedIn will suggest people to follow.

The point of LinkedIn is visibility and networking. If you lock everything down, you lose most of the benefit. Either be present and visible, or do not be there at all.\n\n\n3.7.2 Blocking\nYou can block people who are problematic. Go to their profile, click More, and select Block.

Sharing papers and resources from others with your own commentary is valuable.\nAdd your perspective: why is this worth reading? What did you learn? This does more than share a link. It explains what makes the paper noteworthy and positions you as someone with expertise. It is entirely possible to build a following by being a person who shares a lot of stuff people find interesting and have none of it be your own work.\n\n\n\nSharing a paper from someone else\n\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Reflecting on experience\nPosts that share genuine experience resonate strongly. What you have learned, what challenged you, what you wish you had known earlier. This can work because it shares specific insights from real experience.\n\n\n\n4.2.4 Asking questions\nAsking questions can invite engagement and is a really useful way of getting information. Remember that specific questions get specific answers. Vague questions (“Any tips for teaching?”) get vague answers.\n\n\n\n4.2.5 Images\nInclude images when you can. They make posts more visually distinctive in the feed and increase engagement. Even a screenshot of an abstract or a figure from a paper is better than plain text.\nIf you give a talk, take a photo of the room or your slides. If you are at a conference, document it.

Once a day is plenty. Several times a week is fine. Multiple times a day and you risk becoming noise.\nControversial takes for the sake of engagement.

Internal discussions, strategic decisions, personnel matters, anything covered by agreements or policies. Do not share these, even vaguely or anonymously.\nBe particularly careful about students. Even positive stories can be problematic. “I had a student who…” posts can be identifying, even when you think they are not. Students read LinkedIn. Your colleagues read LinkedIn. What feels like a heartwarming anecdote might feel like an invasion of privacy to the person involved.\nBefore posting anything about students, ask: would I be comfortable if they saw this? Would I be comfortable if their parents saw this? If the answer is no, do not post it.\n\n\n4.4.2 Institutional sensitivities\nYour institution can see what you post and these days your institution almost certainly has a social media policy you should be aware of. Before sharing strong opinions about policies, decisions, or directions, consider whether it could create problems, either by violating policy or just by coming across to your colleagues as someone they don’t really want to work with. This does not mean you cannot be critical and fReEdOm Of SpEeCh still exists. It means being strategic about what you say publicly versus what you say in other contexts.\n\n\n4.4.3 Personal content\nHow much personal content to share is your choice. Some people keep LinkedIn strictly professional where others share personal updates, hobbies, and life events. I have always had a proportion of my posts be more personal in nature, I share about climbing mountains and my wife and sometimes just stuff I find funny. I try to keep this to less than a third of my overall content so it’s still firmly professional but I think there is a benefit to showing some personality, particularly in the age of generic AI slop.\n\nHowever, there is no right answer and it doesn’t come without risk so think about what you are comfortable with being permanently public and what you are willing for the world to know about you. LinkedIn posts are searchable and current and future employers, collaborators, and students may see them. Share what you are genuinely comfortable with and don’t worry what other people aredoing.",

Teaching innovations developed in isolation get reinvented constantly across institutions. Sharing what you do breaks that cycle.\nYour teaching innovations deserve an audience beyond your own classroom. When you develop an effective assessment approach, solve a common pedagogical problem, or create a useful resource, others could benefit.\nLinkedIn connects you with educators across institutions and sectors. Learning technologists, educational developers, trainers in professional contexts, and academics in other disciplines often face similar challenges. These connections can be professionally valuable and lead to collaborations.\nSharing teaching practice also builds your portfolio. Education-focused careers benefit from documented evidence of innovation and impact. Public posts that generate engagement demonstrate reach in ways that internal reports cannot.",

    "section": "5.2 What to Share",
    "text": "5.2 What to Share\n\n5.2.1 Teaching approaches and innovations\nShare what you do in your teaching and why. A new approach you tried and how it went. An assessment design that worked well (or did not, and what you learned). How you structure a particular type of session.\nBe specific enough that others could adapt your approach.\n\nThis semester I have been working my way through the redesign of our course Applied Data Skills, which was originally a 10-credit online micro-credential and is being resurrected and reimagined as a 20-credit, on-campus course as part of our new Curriculum for Life portfolio.\nOne of the things I have tried to do is ensure students learn about AI and coding from a critical and psychologically literate perspective and I have redesigned a previously formative exercise into a summative assessment I am, if I do say so myself, quite pleased with.\n\nStudents are given a dataset and a finished report and tasked with backwards engineering the report. They are told not to use AI at all for this attempt.\nThey then peer review two other submissions and provide feedback using a rubric. If they submit the report, do the peer review, and have attended 75% of the workshops (extenuating circumstances and disability notwithstanding) they are awarded a grade for participation (15%). The attendance component is designed to support the strong narrative that coding is not a skill that can be learned through cramming, but requires consistent, and spaced, practice.\nIn the following workshop, they are then tasked with producing the report, but AI has to write every single line of code. They do this as a paired exercise so they can compare how their different prompts affect the output.\n\n\nThis shares enough detail that someone could implement a similar approach and explains the pedagogical reasoning.\n\n\n5.2.2 Commenting on current issues\nWhen issues arise in higher education that relate to your expertise, share your perspective.\n\nI’ve been putting off reading this because I knew it would make me angry and I was right. The first, the last, and the only question you should have in response to when someone says there are too many people in higher education is “whose children should still get to go?” Because the answer will reveal that higher education does still have value and prestige, but only if you’re from the right background.\n\nThis positions you as someone who engages critically with current debates.\n\n\n5.2.3 Reflections and lessons learned\nSome of the most valuable teaching content is reflective. What you wish you had known when you started teaching. How your teaching philosophy has evolved. Lessons from teaching the same content over many years.\n\nIt’s been a funny September. The changes to my role means I’m doing a lot less teaching and a lot more behind the scenes work. August was like being hit in the face with a brick but September has been calmer (I stress calmER, not calm) which is a 180 to the last decade. If I told you how much I enjoy my new role, you’d accuse me of performative sycophancy so suffice to say I feel like I am where I am supposed to be and I am being challenged and supported in all the right ways (that is, not too much, but not too little of either).\nBut nothing, and I repeat nothing, will ever mean as much and get me up in the morning so happily as lecturing new first year students ❤️\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Sharing resources\nWhen you share teaching resources, host them somewhere that provides analytics. This matters for demonstrating impact. If your slides are on your personal website, you cannot easily show how many people downloaded them. If they are on the Open Science Framework, Zenodo, or an institutional repository, you get download counts.\n\nHad an absolute blast visiting Leeds this week. Gave a talk for the Faculty of Biomedical Sciences about lecture capture and then nipped across to Psychology to talk about how and why we should teach data skills and open science as part of any psychology curriculum (both sets of slides available at [OSF link]).\n\nUse a CC BY licence so that people who use your resources have to credit you. This is important for tracking impact and ensuring your contribution is recognised. More on licensing in Chapter 5.",

Your network will not evaporate.\nIf you notice any of these signs, consider a break:\n\nYou are checking LinkedIn compulsively\nSeeing others’ posts consistently makes you feel bad\nYou are anxious about engagement on your own posts\nLinkedIn feels like an obligation rather than something useful\nYou are losing time you cannot afford to lose\n\nStep away.

Many successful academics do not use it at all.\nIf LinkedIn serves your professional goals and does not damage your wellbeing, great. Use it.\nIf it makes you miserable, takes too much time, or does not actually help you achieve anything meaningful, stop.\nYour wellbeing matters more than your LinkedIn presence.",

Deviate from it whenever you have something better to post.\nSet up your profile following Chapter 2. Your headline, About section, and photo should be complete before you start posting.\nFix your notification settings. Seriously. Do this now.\nFollow 20-30 people. Colleagues, people in your field, organisations you care about. You need content in your feed to engage with.\nEnable followers if you have not already.",

Something like: “I’m going to try actually using LinkedIn this year. Expect posts about [your area]. Feel free to follow along or tell me what I’m doing wrong.”\n\n\n8.2.2 Day 2\nShare something you have read recently. A paper, a report, a useful blog post. Add why it is interesting. Tag the authors if they are on LinkedIn.\n\n\n8.2.3 Day 3\nComment on someone else’s post. Not “great post!” but something substantive. Ask a question, add a related point, share your experience.\n\n\n8.2.4 Day 4\nShare something about your own work. A paper you published, a resource you created, a project you are working on. Explain what it is and why it matters.\n\n\n8.2.5 Day 5\nReflect on the week. What did you notice? What got engagement? What felt comfortable or uncomfortable?",

Something you are actually curious about or need help with.\n\n\n8.3.3 Day 8\nShare something from behind the scenes of your work. What your desk looks like. What you are reading. A view from your commute.\n\n\n8.3.4 Day 9\nEngage with others. Spend your LinkedIn time commenting rather than posting. Aim for 3-5 substantive comments on posts you find interesting.\n\n\n8.3.5 Day 10\nShare something that did not work. A project that failed, a lesson learned the hard way, a mistake you made.
