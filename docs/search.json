    "text": "0.1 Why This Book Exists\nI consider myself lucky to have experienced academic Twitter of the 2010s - I have long-standing research collaborations with people I met on Twitter, I owe my job at Glasgow to Twitter, and I even made a new best friend from Twitter. And then it collapsed into a hateful cesspit and academic social media fractured. Some academics migrated to Bluesky, Mastodon and Threads, but to everyone’s genuine surprise, many, including myself, have settled on LinkedIn.\nIn 2020, Daniel Quintana wrote Twitter for Scientists, a practical guide to using Twitter for academic networking and research dissemination. This book is a sequel of sorts, adapted for LinkedIn and updated for the current landscape. It is not a replacement and if you want comprehensive guidance on why academics should engage with social media at all, you should still read Dan’s original. This book assumes you have already decided that some form of professional social media presence might be useful and focuses on making LinkedIn work for you specifically.",

It also includes material that Dan’s original did not emphasise, in particular, using LinkedIn to share teaching practice and open educational resources. Not because Twitter was bad for this, but because teaching-focused academics have historically been underserved by guidance on academic social media use and because I am a ride-or-die education-focused academic.",

    "text": "2.1 The Post-Twitter Landscape\nDan’s original book makes the case for why academics should use social media at all. The short version is that academia is not a meritocracy, good work does not automatically find its audience, and social media provides a way to share your work that does not depend on gatekeepers. If you want the full argument with evidence, read Chapter 1 of Twitter for Scientists.\nThis chapter addresses the different question of why LinkedIn is a viable alternative (if not a true spiritual replacement) for Good Twitter.\nFor about a decade, Twitter was the main home of academic social media with people sharing papers, building new and wider collaborations, and creating genuine communities around shared interests (in addition to mixing in enough memes and shitposting to never take itself too seriously). It was chaotic, occasionally toxic, but undeniably useful and fun.\nThat era is over and changes to the platform since 2022 have driven many academics elsewhere, including LinkedIn, BlueSky, Mastodon and Threads. I have spent several years trying most of the alternatives and settled on LinkedIn - it’s nowhere near as fun or addictive at Old Twitter but it’s proven the best professional option for me so this book aims to help make the transition easier for others.",

Your potential audience includes academics, but also professionals in industry, policy, healthcare, education, and other sectors where your work might have relevance.\nStability. Unlike platforms that have undergone dramatic changes in ownership or policy, LinkedIn has remained relatively consistent. Your investment in building a presence is less likely to be wiped out by platform upheaval or the whims of a ketamine binge.\nProfessional context. LinkedIn’s culture is explicitly professional. This shapes expectations in ways that can be useful: users post under their real name and are linked to their workplace so bad behaviour and toxicity is much less common. Posts are generally taken seriously and the tone tends toward constructive rather than combative.\nAcademic discourse. LinkedIn does support genuine academic discussion. It is slower and less spontaneous than Twitter was, but substantive conversations happen. You can share papers, debate ideas, and engage with others’ work. The threading is clunkier and the real-time back-and-forth doesn’t take hold as much, but the discourse exists.\nReach beyond academia. If your work has implications for practice, policy, or the public, LinkedIn connects you with people who might actually use it. Practitioners, policymakers, journalists, and industry professionals are all active on the platform.",

The rapid-fire exchanges and viral/trending content that characterised academic Twitter do not really happen on LinkedIn. Conversations unfold over hours or days rather than minutes. This can be frustrating if you are used to real-time debate or enjoy a side order of chaos.\nAlgorithmic unpredictability. Like all platforms, LinkedIn uses algorithms to determine what appears in feeds. Industry analyses suggest organic reach has declined by approximately 50% in recent years, with engagement down around 25%. Your posts may not reach your followers reliably, and there is little transparency about why.\nA corporate aesthetic. LinkedIn’s culture skews toward corporate professionalism. The performative positivity and motivational content can be grating. You will scroll past a lot of “I’m humbled to announce” posts.",

    "text": "2.4 Does Social Media Actually Help Academics?\nThere is peer-reviewed evidence that social media engagement is associated with academic outcomes, though the research has focused more on Twitter than LinkedIn specifically.\nKlar and colleagues (2023) analysed 8,512 applied researchers in Germany and found that researchers’ popularity on social media correlated with both their visibility (measured by citations) and interconnectedness (measured by collaborations) in the publication domain. Importantly, they found that the relationship differed by platform: Twitter popularity was more strongly associated with citations from distinct authors, while LinkedIn followers had higher marginal effects on the number of distinct co-authors. The authors conclude that “social media platforms are a relevant channel of academic communication, alongside existing channels of formal and informal exchange.”\nA Nature survey of over 3,500 researchers found that ResearchGate, LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter were the most visited platforms. The primary reason researchers maintained profiles was simply to be discoverable: “maintaining a profile in case someone wanted to get in touch.” After that, the most popular activities were posting content related to work, discovering peers, and tracking metrics.\nThe evidence suggests social media is genuinely useful for academics, not just a distraction. But the specific benefits depend on what you want to achieve and which platform you use.",

The headline appears in search results, next to your comments, and when you appear in someone’s feed so it should tell people what you do and why they might want to follow you.\n\n\n\nProfile with headline, photo, and banner\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Your About section\nThis is your chance to say who you are in your own words. Write in first person. Be specific about your work and interests. Include enough personality that you sound like a human being.\nHere is mine as an example:\n\nAbout I am Associate Dean for Learning and Teaching and Professor of Evidence-Informed Education at the University of Glasgow. My research predominantly focuses on lecture capture, how it can be used as an effective study tool by students and the impact on students from widening participation backgrounds as well as those with disabilities and neurodivergent conditions. In all my work, I draw on theories of learning from cognitive science and self-regulation, as well as theories of belonging and self-efficacy.\n\n\nMy leadership roles have centred around supporting those on the learning, teaching, and scholarship track. I am currently lead of the College of MVLS LTS Network and previously founded and led the Pedagogy and Education Research Unit in the School of Psychology and Neuroscience.\n\n\nI am based in the School of Psychology and Neuroscience. My teaching is varied although centres on cognitive psychology and beginner data skills in R and I am a vocal advocate of open science and open educational resources where as a member of the PsyTeachR team I have authored several open-access data skills books and tutorials.\n\n\nWhen I am not at work I like to climb mountains, do stand-up comedy, and play videogames.\n\n\nAlso, super gay.\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Profile photo and banner\nUse a photo where people can see your face. It does not need to be a fully professional headshot, but it should be recognisable and suitable for a work profile. People identify posts by the thumbnail, so consistency helps and if you change your profile photo too often, you’ll lose your “branding”.\nThe banner image is optional but useful. Common choices include a photo of your institution, an image related to your research, a landscape from where you live, or something that reflects your personality.\n\n\n3.1.4 The rest\nLinkedIn has a lot of other profile sections - as an academic I would recommend using the Experience section to list your academic positions and Education to state your degrees and which institutions you have attended. The rest (Featured posts, Skills, Awards, Publications etc.) is up to you and I think these have diminishing returns for the effort they take.",

This means the default button on your profile becomes “Follow” rather than “Connect.” People can still connect if they click through, but following becomes the easier option.\nThis is useful if you want a broader audience. Connections have a limit (30,000) but followers do not. There is also evidence that LinkedIn’s algorithm now favours followers over connections for content distribution, with approximately 10-15% of connections seeing a typical post compared to 25-30% of followers.

    "section": "3.3 Understanding the Feed",
    "text": "3.3 Understanding the Feed\n\n3.3.1 How the algorithm works\nLinkedIn uses an algorithm to determine what appears in your feed. You will not see everything from everyone you follow. The algorithm prioritises content it predicts you will engage with, based on your past behaviour, the content’s early performance, and various other factors that LinkedIn does not fully disclose.\nUnlike Twitter, where academic researchers extensively studied how the platform works, there is relatively little peer-reviewed research on LinkedIn’s algorithm specifically. Most of what we know comes from industry analyses rather than controlled studies. That said, here is what seems to matter based on available evidence:\nEarly engagement. According to Richard van der Blom’s Algorithm Insights 2025 research, the first 30-60 minutes after posting are crucial. Posts that get likes and especially comments during this window tend to be shown more widely. Hootsuite’s analysis confirms that posts getting strong interaction in the first hour are shown to second and third-degree connections more frequently. This is why posting when your audience is active matters and you can schedule your posts if you’re not available during these times.\nComments over likes. Multiple analyses suggest comments signal higher engagement than reactions. One industry report suggests comments may be weighted up to 15 times more than likes, while another citing LinkedIn’s own Transparency Report suggests meaningful comments contribute up to 5 times more to reach than reactions. The exact multiplier varies, but the direction is consistent that comments matter more than likes.\nDwell time. How long people spend reading your post matters. Hootsuite notes that LinkedIn places increasing weight on dwell time, meaning posts that keep users engaged for longer see better distribution. Content that people actually read (not just scroll past) gets favoured.\nOriginal content. There is reasonable evidence that reposts get less engagement than original posts. Analysis from multiple sources suggests reposted content may receive around 85% less engagement than original content following algorithm changes in 2024, and that heavy reposting can drag down your overall metrics. If you want to share someone else’s content, writing your own post that references or builds on their work typically performs better than using the repost button.\nLinks. Single external links in posts appear to reduce reach, possibly because LinkedIn wants to keep users on the platform. One analysis suggests posts with external links without sufficient context receive 83% less distribution, while another suggests roughly 30% reduction. The evidence is mixed, but many people now put links in the first comment rather than the post itself. Whether this actually helps is unclear, but it has become a common practice.\nEngagement bait is penalised. The algorithm now recognises patterns like “Comment YES if you agree!” and may flag them as low-quality or spam. Ask genuine questions that invite real discussion rather than fishing for empty engagement.\nAI-generated content may perform worse. Some analyses suggest posts with recognisable AI patterns achieve significantly less organic reach. Whether this is algorithmic detection or simply that AI content tends to be less engaging is unclear, but authentic human-written content appears to perform better.\nThat all said, don’t obsess over the algorithm - it will change, the evidence is mostly anecdotal, and being an interesting person who posts stuff people want to engage with matters more than gaming the system. But it helps to understand the basics.\n\n\n3.3.2 Saving posts [bookmarks]\nAn annoying feature of LinkedIn is that in algorithmic view, it can sometimes be hard to find a post you have previously seen, unless you remember exactly who posted it. This is particularly annoying when the page refreshes without you asking it to. You can save posts by clicking the three dots at the top of the post then “Save”.\n\n\n\nSaving posts for later\n\n\nYou can access your saved posts on the desktop by navigating to your home page and then in the left hand menu bar towards the bottom, click Saved items. On mobile, you just hit your profile picture and Saved posts is one of the items that comes up in the menu bar.\n\n\n3.3.3 Switching to chronological\nBy default, LinkedIn shows you an algorithmic feed. You can switch to chronological order if you prefer to see posts in the order they were posted.\nOn desktop: look for the feed sorting option near the top of your feed and select “Recent.” On mobile: tap your profile picture, then Settings &gt; Account preferences &gt; Preferred feed view and select “Most recent.”\nNote that LinkedIn tends to reset this to algorithmic periodically, so you may need to switch it back.",

    "text": "3.5 Interacting with Content\n\n3.5.1 Reactions\nLinkedIn offers several reaction options: Like, Celebrate, Support, Love, Insightful, Funny. For most purposes, just use Like. The others exist but rarely matter. Reacting acknowledges content but does not boost it significantly. Comments matter more for visibility.\n\n\n3.5.2 Comments\nLinkedIn massively favours comments for reach to the point where a comment on someone else’s post can be more valuable for building connections than your own posts. Research to Action suggests a good rule of thumb for researchers is to comment five times as often as you post. That said, if you’re going to comment, say something substantive. “Great post!” adds nothing. Engage with the actual content: ask a question, add a related point, share your own experience, respectfully disagree.\n\n\n3.5.3 Reposts\nYou can repost others’ content, either directly or with your own commentary added. As noted above, reposts tend to get less engagement than original posts. If you want to amplify someone’s work, consider writing your own post that engages with their content and tags them, rather than using the repost function. You will likely reach more people and add more value.\nIf you do repost, add your own thoughts. A bare repost without commentary is the lowest-value option.\n\n\n3.5.4 Direct messages\nYou can message people directly. This is useful for conversations that do not need to be public, or for reaching out to people you want to connect with. Keep messages short, especially if you are contacting someone you do not know. Say who you are, why you are reaching out, and what you are asking. Long messages from strangers often go unread.\nDo not use DMs to pitch products or services. Do not send connection requests with sales messages attached. And for the love of god, DO NOT DM WOMEN TRYING TO HIT ON THEM.",

Either be present and visible, or do not be there at all.\n\n\n3.7.2 Blocking\nYou can block people who are problematic. Go to their profile, click More, and select Block.

That’s it. Everything else is details. You are well-placed to educate because you have expertise. You do not need to be the world’s leading authority on a topic to have something worth sharing.

Sharing papers and resources from others with your own commentary is valuable.\nAdd your perspective: why is this worth reading? What did you learn? This does more than share a link, it explains what makes the paper noteworthy and positions you as someone with expertise. It is entirely possible to build a following by being a person who shares a lot of stuff people find interesting and have none of it be your own work.\n\n\n\nSharing a paper from someone else\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Reflecting on experience\nPosts that share genuine experience resonate strongly. What you have learned, what challenged you, what you wish you had known earlier. This can work because it shares specific insights from real experience.\n\n\n\n4.3.4 Asking questions\nAsking questions can invite engagement and can also be a really useful way of getting information. Remember that specific questions get specific answers and vague questions (“Any tips for teaching?”) get vague answers.\n\n\n\n4.3.5 Images\nInclude images when you can. They make posts more visually distinctive in the feed and increase engagement. Even a screenshot of an abstract or a figure from a paper is better than plain text.\nIf you give a talk, take a photo of the room or your slides. If you are at a conference, document it. If you are reading something interesting, photograph the book. These do not need to be professional quality. They just need to break up the text and give people something to look at.",

Internal discussions, strategic decisions, personnel matters, anything covered by agreements or policies. Do not share these, even vaguely or anonymously.\nBe particularly careful about students. Even positive stories can be problematic. “I had a student who…” posts can be identifying, even when you think they are not. Students read LinkedIn. Your colleagues read LinkedIn. What feels like a heartwarming anecdote might feel like an invasion of privacy to the person involved.\nBefore posting anything about students, ask: would I be comfortable if they saw this? Would I be comfortable if their parents saw this? If the answer is no, do not post it.\n\n\n4.5.2 Institutional sensitivities\nYour institution can see what you post and these days your institution almost certainly has a social media policy you should be aware of. Before sharing strong opinions about policies, decisions, or directions, consider whether it could create problems, either by violating policy or just by coming across to your colleagues as someone they don’t really want to work with. This does not mean you cannot be critical and fReEdOm Of SpEeCh still exists. It means being strategic about what you say publicly versus what you say in other contexts.\n\n\n4.5.3 Personal content\nHow much personal content to share is your choice. Some people keep LinkedIn strictly professional where others share personal updates, hobbies, and life events. I have always had a proportion of my posts be more personal in nature, I share about climbing mountains and my wife and sometimes just stuff I find funny. I try to keep this to less than a third of my overall content so it’s still firmly professional but I think there is a benefit to showing some personality, particularly in the age of generic AI slop.\n\nHowever, there is no right answer and it doesn’t come without risk so think about what you are comfortable with being permanently public and what you are willing for the world to know about you. LinkedIn posts are searchable and current and future employers, collaborators, and students may see them. Share what you are genuinely comfortable with and don’t worry what other people are doing.",

    "text": "5.1.1 Teaching approaches and innovations\nShare what you do in your teaching and why. A new approach you tried and how it went. An assessment design that worked well (or did not, and what you learned). How you structure a particular type of session.\nBe specific enough that others could adapt your approach.\n\nThis semester I have been working my way through the redesign of our course Applied Data Skills, which was originally a 10-credit online micro-credential and is being resurrected and reimagined as a 20-credit, on-campus course as part of our new Curriculum for Life portfolio.\nOne of the things I have tried to do is ensure students learn about AI and coding from a critical and psychologically literate perspective and I have redesigned a previously formative exercise into a summative assessment I am, if I do say so myself, quite pleased with.\n\nStudents are given a dataset and a finished report and tasked with backwards engineering the report. They are told not to use AI at all for this attempt.\nThey then peer review two other submissions and provide feedback using a rubric. If they submit the report, do the peer review, and have attended 75% of the workshops (extenuating circumstances and disability notwithstanding) they are awarded a grade for participation (15%). The attendance component is designed to support the strong narrative that coding is not a skill that can be learned through cramming, but requires consistent, and spaced, practice.\nIn the following workshop, they are then tasked with producing the report, but AI has to write every single line of code. They do this as a paired exercise so they can compare how their different prompts affect the output.\n\n\nThis shares enough detail that someone could implement a similar approach and explains the pedagogical reasoning.\n\n\n5.1.2 Commenting on current issues\nWhen issues arise in higher education that relate to your expertise, share your perspective.\n\nI’ve been putting off reading this because I knew it would make me angry and I was right. The first, the last, and the only question you should have in response to when someone says there are too many people in higher education is “whose children should still get to go?” Because the answer will reveal that higher education does still have value and prestige, but only if you’re from the right background.\n\nThis positions you as someone who engages critically with current debates.",

    "section": "5.2 Sharing Open Educational Resources",
    "text": "5.2 Sharing Open Educational Resources\nIf you create teaching materials, making them openly available extends their impact beyond your own institution. Many educators create similar resources in isolation. Across institutions, countless hours are spent developing introductory lectures, assessment rubrics, and practical guides that already exist elsewhere. Open educational resources address this inefficiency.\n\nOne of the decisions I am proudest of in my role as first year lead has been switching to an open access textbook. I can’t control inflation and the cost of living but I can reduce unnecessary additional costs. We use Open Stax.\n\nThere are also personal benefits. Your expertise becomes visible beyond your institution, you may receive feedback that improves your resources, and you create documented evidence of impact.\n\n5.2.1 Why LinkedIn for OER?\nOER repositories are essential for hosting and discoverability, but they are passive. People have to find your resources through search or browsing. LinkedIn lets you actively push resources to people who might use them.\nWhen you share an OER on LinkedIn, you can explain the context that repository metadata cannot capture. Why you created it, how you use it, what you would do differently. You can invite feedback and engagement. You can reach people who would never have searched for your resource but might find it useful.\n\n\n5.2.2 Licensing your resources\nFor a resource to be genuinely open, it needs a licence that explicitly permits reuse. Without a licence, copyright applies by default, meaning others cannot legally reuse your work even if you share it publicly.\nThe most common approach is Creative Commons. For maximum impact, use CC BY (Attribution). Others can use, adapt, and redistribute your work, including commercially, as long as they credit you. This matters—if you want recognition for your work, CC BY requires attribution. Anyone using your resource has to credit you. This is important for tracking impact and ensuring your contribution is visible.\nOther options like CC BY-NC (non-commercial) or CC BY-SA (share-alike) are available but limit reuse in ways that may reduce impact.\nInclude licence information in the resource itself (on the first or last slide, in the document footer), in the LinkedIn post sharing it, and in any repository listing.\n\n\n5.2.3 Hosting your resources\nWhere you host your resources matters for discoverability, sustainability, and demonstrating impact.\nInstitutional repositories (Glasgow’s is Enlighten) provide stable hosting, institutional recognition, and usually generate DOIs. Check what your institution offers.\nOpen Science Framework is free, easy to use, and provides DOIs, version control, and download analytics. Good for individual resources or collections.\nZenodo is another free option, run by CERN. It generates DOIs automatically and integrates with GitHub.\nGitHub is good for code and version-controlled documents. Integrates with Zenodo for DOI generation.\nPersonal websites can work but have limitations. They do not generate DOIs (which matters for citation and tracking), and may not provide usage analytics.\nDOIs matter because they make your resources citable and trackable. If someone uses your resource in a publication or training materials, a DOI makes proper citation straightforward. It also helps you track where your resources are being referenced.\n\n\n5.2.4 How to share OER on LinkedIn\nWhen sharing an OER, include what it is (specifically—“lecture slides” is too vague, “a set of 12 lecture slide decks covering introductory research methods in psychology” is specific enough to evaluate), who it is for, how to access it, the licence, and any context or guidance on how you use it.\n\nIt’s important to teach students how to learn but not everyone has the time or expertise to develop materials. Inspired by Prof Niamh Stack’s inaugural lecture and call for open educational resources, here’s my How to Study slides for 1st yr University of Glasgow psychology students. You are free to use and adapt the slides as you wish.\nAccess the full slides here [OSF link]\n\n\nHad an absolute blast visiting Leeds this week. Gave a talk for the Faculty of Biomedical Sciences about lecture capture and then nipped across to Psychology to talk about how and why we should teach data skills and open science as part of any psychology curriculum (both sets of slides available at [OSF link]).\n\n\nTo accompany my course Applied Data Skills I have written a companion textbook AI Tutor that aims to teach students about AI through a psychologically literate lens.\nAs always it has a Creative Commons licence so you are free to reuse and remix, with attribution.",

Try to be genuinely useful rather than performatively reflective.\nQuality concerns. Sharing work publicly can feel exposing. Remember that “good enough to be useful” is the bar, not “perfect.”\nInstitutional recognition. OER creation is not always recognised promotion criteria (although it is at UofG) so be aware of your criteria and what metrics of impact might matter.\nAccessibility. Ensure your resources are accessible: document structure, alt text for images, readable fonts. This takes time but matters.\nDocumenting impact. If you want to use your LinkedIn activity as evidence of impact, keep track of engagement metrics, download figures from repositories, and any tangible outcomes (invitations, collaborations, adoptions of your resources). Screenshots are useful because platforms change and posts can disappear. Tools like Altmetric can help track mentions of your work across social media and news outlets.

Research consistently shows that exposure to curated portrayals on social media is associated with lower self-esteem, particularly when we engage in “upward social comparisons” - comparing ourselves to people who appear to be doing better than us (Vogel et al., 2014). When you notice yourself feeling inadequate because of what you see on LinkedIn, remember that you are comparing your behind-the-scenes to everyone else’s highlight reel.

Something useful to your network.\n\n\n7.4.3 Day 13\nRespond to something current. An issue in your field, a recent publication, something in the news. Share your perspective.\n\n\n7.4.4 Day 14\nRepurpose something. Turn part of a talk into a post. Share slides from a recent presentation. Extract a key point from something you have written.\n\n\n7.4.5 Day 15\nReview your posts so far. What got engagement? What did you enjoy writing? What felt forced? Adjust accordingly.",

A photo, a screenshot, a process you are working through. Show rather than tell.\n\n\n7.5.3 Day 18\nEngage with someone new. Find an account you do not follow yet, read their recent posts, comment on something.\n\n\n7.5.4 Day 19\nShare a resource. Something you created or something you have found useful. Include enough context for people to assess whether it is relevant to them.\n\n\n7.5.5 Day 20\nReflect on the month. What worked? What will you continue? Post something about what you have learned.",

    "text": "7.6 After the Bootcamp\nAt this point you will have established a baseline and should have become more comfortable with posting. Now it is time to find what works for you in a way that you can sustain.\nQuality over quantity. You do not need to post every day. A couple of good posts per week is plenty (and sometimes not even that).\nEngage more than you post. Commenting on others’ posts is often more valuable than creating your own.\nRepurpose relentlessly. Talks become posts. Papers become threads. Teaching materials become shared resources.\nFollow your interests. Post about what you actually care about, not what you think will perform well.\nTake breaks. It is fine to be quiet sometimes.",
