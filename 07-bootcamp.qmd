# One-Month Bootcamp {#bootcamp}

If you are new to LinkedIn or have a neglected profile, this 20-day template will get you started. It provides structure if you are not sure what to do. Deviate from it whenever you have something better to post.

## Before You Begin

**Set up your profile** following [Chapter 2](#basics). Your headline, About section, and photo should be complete before you start posting.

**Fix your notification settings.** Seriously. Do this now.

**Follow 20-30 people.** Colleagues, people in your field, organisations you care about. You need content in your feed to engage with.

**Enable followers** if you have not already.

## Week 1: Getting Started

### Day 1
Post that you are going to be more active on LinkedIn. Public accountability helps. Something like: "I'm going to try actually using LinkedIn this year. Expect posts about [your area]. Feel free to follow along or tell me what I'm doing wrong."

### Day 2
Share something you have read recently. A paper, a report, a useful blog post. Add why it is interesting. Tag the authors if they are on LinkedIn.

### Day 3
Comment on someone else's post. Not "great post!" but something substantive. Ask a question, add a related point, share your experience.

### Day 4
Share something about your own work. A paper you published, a resource you created, a project you are working on. Explain what it is and why it matters.

### Day 5
Reflect on the week. What did you notice? What got engagement? What felt comfortable or uncomfortable?

## Week 2: Finding Your Voice

### Day 6
Share a tool, resource, or approach you use regularly. Software, a method, a framework. Explain how you use it and why.

### Day 7
Ask a genuine question. Something you are actually curious about or need help with.

### Day 8
Share something from behind the scenes of your work. What your desk looks like. What you are reading. A view from your commute.

### Day 9
Engage with others. Spend your LinkedIn time commenting rather than posting. Aim for 3-5 substantive comments on posts you find interesting.

### Day 10
Share something that did not work. A project that failed, a lesson learned the hard way, a mistake you made. Honesty resonates.

## Week 3: Building Momentum

### Day 11
Write a longer post. Take a topic you know well and explain something about it in 300-500 words. Share your perspective or expertise.

### Day 12
Promote an event or opportunity. A conference, a talk, a call for papers, an open position. Something useful to your network.

### Day 13
Respond to something current. An issue in your field, a recent publication, something in the news. Share your perspective.

### Day 14
Repurpose something. Turn part of a talk into a post. Share slides from a recent presentation. Extract a key point from something you have written.

### Day 15
Review your posts so far. What got engagement? What did you enjoy writing? What felt forced? Adjust accordingly.

## Week 4: Developing Your Practice

### Day 16
Recommend something. A book, a podcast, a person to follow. Something you genuinely found valuable.

### Day 17
Document something from your work. A photo, a screenshot, a process you are working through. Show rather than tell.

### Day 18
Engage with someone new. Find an account you do not follow yet, read their recent posts, comment on something.

### Day 19
Share a resource. Something you created or something you have found useful. Include enough context for people to assess whether it is relevant to them.

### Day 20
Reflect on the month. What worked? What will you continue? Post something about what you have learned.

## After the Bootcamp

You have established a baseline. Now find what works for you.

**Quality over quantity.** You do not need to post every day. A few good posts per week is plenty.

**Engage more than you post.** Commenting on others' posts is often more valuable than creating your own.

**Repurpose relentlessly.** Talks become posts. Papers become threads. Teaching materials become shared resources.

**Follow your interests.** Post about what you actually care about, not what you think will perform well.

**Take breaks.** It is fine to be quiet sometimes.

The goal is sustainable practice, not burnout.
