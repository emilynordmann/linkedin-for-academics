# Taking Care of Yourself {#self-care}

LinkedIn can be useful. It can also be a time sink, a source of unflattering comparison, and occasionally unpleasant. This chapter covers how to use it without making yourself miserable.

## Managing Your Time

LinkedIn is designed to keep you scrolling. Infinite feeds, notifications, the variable reward of engagement. It is easy to lose hours.

Set boundaries. Check LinkedIn at specific times rather than whenever you are bored. Turn off most notifications (you already did this in [Chapter 2](#basics), right?). Use website blockers if you need them. [SelfControl](https://selfcontrolapp.com/) (Mac) and [Cold Turkey](https://getcoldturkey.com/) (Windows/Mac) can block distracting sites for set periods.

Delete the app from your phone periodically if you find yourself checking it constantly. The world will not end.

Remember that time spent on LinkedIn is time not spent on other things. The opportunity cost matters. A couple of posts a week and some genuine engagement is plenty. You do not need to be constantly present.

## Dealing with Comparison

LinkedIn is a highlight reel. People post their successes, awards, publications, promotions. They do not post their rejections, failures, or struggles (much).

This creates a distorted picture. Everyone else appears to be succeeding constantly while you experience the full range of academic life including the boring and difficult parts. This is not real. It is selection bias.

> So the reflection is to remember that social media is an exercise in branding, that the only thing that lies in social comparison is madness, and that even people like me, who consciously shape their presence to make it seem like you know them, are just showing you want they want you to see.

When you notice yourself feeling inadequate because of what you see on LinkedIn, remember: you are comparing your behind-the-scenes to everyone else's highlight reel. It is not a fair comparison and it is not useful.

If particular accounts make you feel bad about yourself, mute or unfollow them. You do not owe anyone your attention.

## Annoying Content

LinkedIn will show you content you find irritating. Performative positivity, humble-brags, AI-generated slop, takes you disagree with.

You have options.

**Mute people.** If someone's content annoys you but you do not want to unfollow (maybe they are a colleague), mute them. They will not know, and you will not see their posts.

**Mute keywords.** You can mute specific words or phrases. If there is a trending topic driving you mad, mute it.

**Curate your feed.** The more you engage with content you actually like, the more LinkedIn shows you similar content. Engage with what you find valuable, scroll past what you do not.

**Remember you can leave.** You do not have to be on LinkedIn. If the platform consistently makes you unhappy, leaving is a valid option.

## Handling Difficult Interactions

Most interactions on LinkedIn are fine. Occasionally, someone will be rude, dismissive, or hostile.

**You do not have to respond.** Engaging with bad-faith actors rarely improves anything. You can ignore comments, delete them from your posts, or block the person.

**Delete and move on.** You can delete any comment on your own posts. There is no obligation to leave hostile comments visible. Delete them.

**Block freely.** If someone is problematic, block them. When you block someone, they cannot see your profile or content, cannot comment on your posts, and all their existing comments on your posts disappear. Use this.

**Report if necessary.** If content violates LinkedIn's policies, report it. Do not expect rapid response.

## Taking Breaks

It is fine to take breaks from LinkedIn. A week, a month, longer. The platform will still be there. Your network will not evaporate.

If you notice any of these signs, consider a break:

- You are checking LinkedIn compulsively
- Seeing others' posts consistently makes you feel bad
- You are anxious about engagement on your own posts
- LinkedIn feels like an obligation rather than something useful
- You are losing time you cannot afford to lose

Step away. Come back when (if) it feels useful again.

## The Bigger Picture

LinkedIn is a tool. It can be useful for networking, sharing work, building reputation. It is not essential. Many successful academics do not use it at all.

If LinkedIn serves your professional goals and does not damage your wellbeing, great. Use it.

If it makes you miserable, takes too much time, or does not actually help you achieve anything meaningful, stop.

Your wellbeing matters more than your LinkedIn presence.
