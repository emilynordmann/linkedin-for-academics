## Why This Book Exists

In 2020, Daniel Quintana wrote *Twitter for Scientists*, a practical guide to using Twitter for academic networking and research dissemination. It was licensed under Creative Commons, freely available, and genuinely useful. I recommended it to colleagues regularly.

Then Twitter imploded.

The platform that hosted vibrant academic communities became increasingly hostile, algorithmically unpredictable, and politically fraught. Many academics migrated elsewhere: Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads, LinkedIn. Some gave up on social media entirely. Dan's excellent guidance remained relevant in principle but the platform it described no longer existed in any meaningful sense.

This book is a companion to *Twitter for Scientists*, adapted for LinkedIn and updated for the current landscape. It is not a replacement. If you want comprehensive guidance on why academics should engage with social media at all, read Dan's original. This book assumes you have already decided that some form of professional social media presence might be useful and focuses on making LinkedIn work for you specifically.

## Why LinkedIn?

LinkedIn is not Twitter. It never will be. The culture is different, the conventions are different, and the types of interactions it facilitates are different. But it offers something valuable: a stable, professionally-oriented platform where academics can share their work, build networks, and establish expertise.

This book covers LinkedIn basics, content strategy, and maintaining your wellbeing on the platform. It also includes material that Dan's original did not emphasise: using LinkedIn to share teaching practice and open educational resources. Not because Twitter was bad for this, but because teaching-focused academics have historically been underserved by guidance on academic social media use.
