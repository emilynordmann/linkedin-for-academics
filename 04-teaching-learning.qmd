# Sharing Teaching Practice {#teaching}

If you focus primarily on teaching, LinkedIn offers a way to share your work with people who might benefit from it. Teaching innovations developed in isolation get reinvented constantly across institutions. Sharing what you do breaks that cycle.

## What to Share

### Teaching approaches and innovations

Share what you do in your teaching and why. A new approach you tried and how it went. An assessment design that worked well (or did not, and what you learned). How you structure a particular type of session.

Be specific enough that others could adapt your approach.

> This semester I have been working my way through the redesign of our course Applied Data Skills, which was originally a 10-credit online micro-credential and is being resurrected and reimagined as a 20-credit, on-campus course as part of our new Curriculum for Life portfolio.
>
> One of the things I have tried to do is ensure students learn about AI and coding from a critical and psychologically literate perspective and I have redesigned a previously formative exercise into a summative assessment I am, if I do say so myself, quite pleased with.
>
> 1. Students are given a dataset and a finished report and tasked with backwards engineering the report. They are told not to use AI at all for this attempt.
> 2. They then peer review two other submissions and provide feedback using a rubric. If they submit the report, do the peer review, and have attended 75% of the workshops (extenuating circumstances and disability notwithstanding) they are awarded a grade for participation (15%). The attendance component is designed to support the strong narrative that coding is not a skill that can be learned through cramming, but requires consistent, and spaced, practice.
> 3. In the following workshop, they are then tasked with producing the report, but AI has to write every single line of code. They do this as a paired exercise so they can compare how their different prompts affect the output.

This shares enough detail that someone could implement a similar approach and explains the pedagogical reasoning.

### Commenting on current issues

When issues arise in higher education that relate to your expertise, share your perspective.

> I've been putting off reading this because I knew it would make me angry and I was right. The first, the last, and the only question you should have in response to when someone says there are too many people in higher education is "whose children should still get to go?" Because the answer will reveal that higher education does still have value and prestige, but only if you're from the right background.

This positions you as someone who engages critically with current debates.

## Sharing Open Educational Resources

If you create teaching materials, making them openly available extends their impact beyond your own institution. Many educators create similar resources in isolation. Across institutions, countless hours are spent developing introductory lectures, assessment rubrics, and practical guides that already exist elsewhere. Open educational resources address this inefficiency.

> One of the decisions I am proudest of in my role as first year lead has been switching to an open access textbook. I can't control inflation and the cost of living but I can reduce unnecessary additional costs. We use Open Stax.

There are also personal benefits. Your expertise becomes visible beyond your institution, you may receive feedback that improves your resources, and you create documented evidence of impact.

### Why LinkedIn for OER?

OER repositories are essential for hosting and discoverability, but they are passive. People have to find your resources through search or browsing. LinkedIn lets you actively push resources to people who might use them.

When you share an OER on LinkedIn, you can explain the context that repository metadata cannot capture. Why you created it, how you use it, what you would do differently. You can invite feedback and engagement. You can reach people who would never have searched for your resource but might find it useful.

### Licensing your resources

For a resource to be genuinely open, it needs a licence that explicitly permits reuse. Without a licence, copyright applies by default, meaning others cannot legally reuse your work even if you share it publicly.

The most common approach is Creative Commons. For maximum impact, use **CC BY (Attribution)**. Others can use, adapt, and redistribute your work, including commercially, as long as they credit you. This matters—if you want recognition for your work, CC BY requires attribution. Anyone using your resource has to credit you. This is important for tracking impact and ensuring your contribution is visible.

Other options like CC BY-NC (non-commercial) or CC BY-SA (share-alike) are available but limit reuse in ways that may reduce impact.

Include licence information in the resource itself (on the first or last slide, in the document footer), in the LinkedIn post sharing it, and in any repository listing.

### Hosting your resources

Where you host your resources matters for discoverability, sustainability, and demonstrating impact.

**Institutional repositories** ([Glasgow's is Enlighten](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/library/enlighten/)) provide stable hosting, institutional recognition, and usually generate DOIs. Check what your institution offers.

**[Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/)** is free, easy to use, and provides DOIs, version control, and download analytics. Good for individual resources or collections.

**[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)** is another free option, run by CERN. It generates DOIs automatically and integrates with GitHub.

**[GitHub](https://github.com/)** is good for code and version-controlled documents. Integrates with Zenodo for DOI generation.

**Personal websites** can work but have limitations. They do not generate DOIs (which matters for citation and tracking), and may not provide usage analytics.

DOIs matter because they make your resources citable and trackable. If someone uses your resource in a publication or training materials, a DOI makes proper citation straightforward. It also helps you track where your resources are being referenced.

### How to share OER on LinkedIn

When sharing an OER, include what it is (specifically—"lecture slides" is too vague, "a set of 12 lecture slide decks covering introductory research methods in psychology" is specific enough to evaluate), who it is for, how to access it, the licence, and any context or guidance on how you use it.

> It's important to teach students how to learn but not everyone has the time or expertise to develop materials. Inspired by Prof Niamh Stack's inaugural lecture and call for open educational resources, here's my How to Study slides for 1st yr University of Glasgow psychology students. You are free to use and adapt the slides as you wish.

> Had an absolute blast visiting Leeds this week. Gave a talk for the Faculty of Biomedical Sciences about lecture capture and then nipped across to Psychology to talk about how and why we should teach data skills and open science as part of any psychology curriculum (both sets of slides available at [OSF link]).

> To accompany my course Applied Data Skills I have written a companion textbook AI Tutor that aims to teach students about AI through a psychologically literate lens.
>
> As always it has a Creative Commons licence so you are free to reuse and remix, with attribution.

## Challenges

**Institutional sensitivities.** Not everything about your teaching context can be shared publicly. Be thoughtful about what you post, especially regarding challenges or criticisms.

**Student privacy.** Even positive stories about students can be problematic. See [Chapter 3](#content) for more on this.

**Avoiding performative reflection.** There is a genre of teaching post that is more about signalling how much you care than sharing useful information. Try to be genuinely useful rather than performatively reflective.

**Quality concerns.** Sharing work publicly can feel exposing. Remember that "good enough to be useful" is the bar, not "perfect."

**Institutional recognition.** OER creation is not always recognised promotion criteria (although it is at UofG) so be aware of your criteria and what metrics of impact might matter.

**Accessibility.** Ensure your resources are accessible: document structure, alt text for images, readable fonts. This takes time but matters.

**Documenting impact.** If you want to use your LinkedIn activity as evidence of impact, keep track of engagement metrics, download figures from repositories, and any tangible outcomes (invitations, collaborations, adoptions of your resources). Screenshots are useful because platforms change and posts can disappear. Tools like [Altmetric](https://www.altmetric.com/) can help track mentions of your work across social media and news outlets. Linking your publications to your [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) profile also helps maintain a consistent academic identity across platforms.
